## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("app.py", "Contains the main Flask application. It should handle file uploads, initiate the DataProcessor, and display results."),
    ("data_processing.py", "Contains the DataProcessor class. It should perform exact, substring, and fuzzy matching on the uploaded data."),
    ("templates/index.html", "The main page of the web application. It should contain a form for file upload and column selection."),
    ("templates/result.html", "The results page of the web application. It should display the matching results."),
    ("static/styles.css", "Contains the CSS styles for the web application.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "static/styles.css",
    "templates/index.html",
    "templates/result.html",
    "data_processing.py",
    "app.py"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
The 'data_processing.py' file contains the DataProcessor class. This class uses pandas for data manipulation and fuzzywuzzy for fuzzy matching. It has three main methods: exact_match, substring_match, and fuzzy_match. These methods perform different types of matching on the uploaded data.

The 'app.py' file contains the main Flask application. It uses the DataProcessor class to perform matching on the uploaded data. The results are then displayed using Flask's render_template function.

The 'templates/index.html' and 'templates/result.html' files are used to create the user interface of the web application. The 'static/styles.css' file contains the CSS styles for the web application.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The performance of fuzzy matching on large datasets might be a concern. We may need to implement some form of pagination or limit the number of rows processed at a time. Also, we need to ensure that the user interface is intuitive and easy to use.
